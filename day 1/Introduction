DOCKERS INTRODUCTION


What is Docker?
	Docker is a container platform that allows user to devlop, test and build application. 

Dockerfiles:	A developer defines all the applications and it's dependencies on a Dockerfile which is then used to build Docker images that defines a Docker container. This ensures that application will run in any environment.

Docker Image:	Docker Image is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. A Docker Image is a file that defines a Docker Container. This image informs how a container should instantiate, determining which software components will run and how.

Docker Container:	Docker Container is a virtual environment that bundles application code with all the dependencies required to run the application.

Why use Docker?
	Initially to run a application before a independent server was required, if we want to run another application we need another sever.
	This is disadvantages in many ways, to solve this problem VMware created Virtual Machines.
	Virtual Machine create a virtual environment to run several applictions on the same machine.
	VMs are created using Hypervisors.
	It divides the system resoureces such as os, storage, etc. for each application. No application knows what the other applicatoin doing.
	Disadvantages with VM are that they split the system resources specially os which effects the appliction performance.
	Solution to this problem is containers.  A container encapsulates an application with its own operating environment. It can be placed on any host machine without special configuration, removing the issue of dependencies. Containerization is a lightweight approach to virtualization.
